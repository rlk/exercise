<h2><a name="1-2-3-4-chromatic-warm-up">1-2-3-4 Chromatic Warm-up</a></h2>

<p>This exercise develops <a href="#timing">timing</a>, <a href="#coordination">coordination</a>, <a href="#consistency">consistency</a>, and <a href="#fluidity">fluidity</a>. It builds the muscle memory to fret every position with every finger. It trains <a href="#damping">damping</a> technique. It is useful as an everyday warm-up.</p>

<p>Begin at the lowest fret of the lowest string and play upward, one fret per finger.</p>

<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=720 >
  tabstave time=4/4
  notes :8 1-2-3-4/6 1-2-3-4/5 | 1-2-3-4/4 1-2-3-4/3 | 1-2-3-4/2 1-2-3-4/1
</div>

<p>At the end, shift up a fret, and proceed downward.

<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=720 >
  tabstave time=4/4
  notes :8 5-4-3-2/1 5-4-3-2/2 | 5-4-3-2/3 5-4-3-2/4 | 5-4-3-2/5 5-4-3-2/6
</div>

<p>Then shift again and head back up.</p>

<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=720 >
  tabstave time=4/4
  notes :8 3-4-5-6/6 3-4-5-6/5 | 3-4-5-6/4 3-4-5-6/3 | 3-4-5-6/2 3-4-5-6/1
</div>

<p>Continue in this pattern to the top of the fretboard, or as high as you deem necessary. Once there, reverse direction and come back down.</p>

<p>Start slow, with the metronome set to a tempo at which you find this exercise easy. Repeat it, increasing the tempo by 10 BPM, until you find it challenging. Don't persist at too high a tempo, as this will only reinforce bad habits. If speed is your goal, remember that you'll get faster through practice over the course of weeks, not minutes.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Focus on tempo. Try to hide the tick of the metronome in the attack of the note.</li>
	<li>Fret each note just as you are about to pluck it. If you fret too late, the note will sound short. If you fret too early, you may produce a hammer-on prior to the pluck, resulting in a doubled note.</li>
	<li>Alternate pick. The metronome ticks on the quarter note, so play each note on the beat with a down stroke, and each note between beats with an up stroke.</li>
	<li>Pay attention to consistency. Make each note sound the same, with the same attack and intensity. Pay particular attention as you skip from one string to the next or from one position to the next.</li>
	<li>Dampen all five of the strings you're not playing at any given moment. Let the edge of your picking hand lie across the heavy strings, and let the index finger of your fretting hand lie over the light strings. Concentrate on shifting the positions of both hands to maintain solid damping as you progress from string to string. Switch off any reverb effect to make damping issues more audible.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Variations</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Alter the pattern. Instead of the 1-2-3-4 fingering, try 1-3-2-4, or 1-4-2-3. Explore the many other alternatives.</li>
	<li>Double-pick, triple-pick, or quadruple-pick each note. This trains tremolo picking.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="chromatic-hammer-ons-and-pull-offs">Chromatic Hammer-ons and Pull-offs</a></h2>

<p>This exercise develops <a href="#timing">timing</a>, <a href="#consistency">consistency</a>, and finger strength, especially in the fourth finger.

<p>Using the first, third, and fourth fingers, pluck the first of three notes and hammer-on the next two. Do this across two strings, move up a fret, and repeat using pull-offs.</p>

<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=720 >
  tabstave time=4/4
  notes :8 1h3h4/6 1h3h4/5 5p4/5 | p2/5 5p4p2/6 3h5h6/6 3/5 | h5h6/5 7p6p4/5 7p6p4/6
</div>

<p>Proceed to the top of the fretboard and back down, then repeat on the next pair of strings.</p>

<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=720 >
  tabstave time=4/4
  notes :8 1h3h4/5 1h3h4/4 5p4/4 | p2/4 5p4p2/5 3h5h6/5 3/4 | h5h6/4 7p6p4/4 7p6p4/5
</div>

<p>Repeat the exercise using the first, second, and fourth fingers.</p>

<div class="vex-tabdiv" width=720 >
  tabstave time=4/4
  notes :8 1h2h4/6 1h2h4/5 5p3/5 | p2/5 5p3p2/6 3h4h6/6 3/5 | h4h6/5 7p5p4/5 7p5p4/6
</div>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Pay special attention to timing. Switching between plucked, hammered, and pulled notes makes measured rhythm difficult.
	<li>Persue consistency, and try to make all notes sound with equal intensity and attack, but understand that perfection there will be unobtainable. Use a clean amplifier and switch off any compressor effect to make consistency issues more audible.</li>
	<li>When performing a pull-off, be careful not to pull the string too far before releasing it, as this can result in bad <a href="#intonation">intonation</a>.
</ol>

<h3>Variations</h3>

<ol>
	<li>This exercises is notated on the eighths, but may be played on triplets if desired. Note that rhymic irregularity may be more difficult to detect and eliminate in triplets.</li>
	<li>This exercise can be performed with four fingers instead of three, and can be performed <a href="#vertical">vertically</a> instead of <a href="#horizontal">horizontally</a>. I find it most effective as presented.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<dl>
	<a id="consistency"><dt>Consistency</dt></a>
	<dd>The uniformity of the intensity and attack across a series of notes.</dd>

	<a id="coordination"><dt>Coordination</dt></a>
	<dd>The precise synchronization of your two hands, for example, fast fingering by your fretting hand simultaneous with fast plucking by your picking hand. </dd>

	<a id="damping"><dt>Damping</dt></a>
	<dd>The supression of unintended sound from strings not being played. When picking single-note lines, use the edge of the picking hand to dampen heavier strings, and the flat front of the fingers of the fretting hand to dampen lighter strings. When chording, dampen unused heavy strings with the tip of the fretting hand index finger, or the thumb wrapped around the neck, leaving the picking hand free to strum.</dd>

	<a id="fluidity"><dt>Fluidity</dt></a>
	<dd>The smoothness with which one note connects with the next, with minimal gap or variation in gap.</dd>

	<a id="frad"><dt>Forward / Reverse &mdash; Ascending / Descending</dt></a>
	<dd>Often, exercises are composed of small patterns repeated across the fretboard. Whenever possible, we practice these patterns both forward and in reverse, while both ascending and descending the fretboard. Thus each pattern is encountered in four ways: forward-ascending, forward-descending, reverse-ascending, and reverse-descending.</dd>

	<a id="horizontal"><dt>Horizontal</dt></a>
	<dd>The axis along the length of the fretboard, from one fret to the next. The opposite of <a href="#vertical">vertical</a>.</dd>

	<a id="intonation"><dt>Intonation</dt></a>
	<dd>The correct pitch of a note. Correct pitch is most generally established by the tuning of the instrument and the correct adjustment of the bridge. However, pressing the string too hard can bend a note sharp, as can pulling too far on a pull-off.</dd>

	<a id="timing"><dt>Timing</dt></a>
	<dd>The ability to produce notes with a precise, regular rhythm, as developed through practice with a metronome and as aided by disciplined alternate picking.</dd>

	<a id="vertical"><dt>Vertical</dt></a>
	<dd>The axis across the fretboard, from one string to the next. The opposite of <a href="#horizontal">horizontal</a>.</dd>
